# `rlLang`-related Source Code

This repository contains all my `rlLang`-related source code, including
a static library for reading the critical chunks of a `rlLang` file
(see `include` and `src` directories) as well as different tools (see
`tools` directory).

For the full specification of the `rlLang` file format, see
[here](https://rle.sh/git-file/Specifications/filetypes/text/rlLang/v1.0.txt).
